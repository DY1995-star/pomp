title: version 3.1.1.1 released

**pomp** development version 3.1.1.1 has just been released on the package github site.
This release introduces the \code{profile_design} function, which is intended to replace \code{profileDesign}.
The so-called profile design consists of a series of slices through a parameter space perpendicular to one or more coordinate axes.
The old behavior was to generate a single set of points in one of these slices (randomly according to a uniform distribution when \code{type="runif"} and according to a sub-random (Sobol') sequence when \code{type="sobol"}) and then copy these points across all slices.
Thus, in a projection perpendicular to the slices, all \code{nprof} generated points would lie atop one another.
The new behavior is to generate the points in each slice independently.
Thus, a projection perpendicular to the slices will display \code{n*nprof} points, where \code{n} is the number of slices.

For stylistic reasons, the other design functions, \code{sliceDesign}, \code{runifDesign}, and \code{sobolDesign} have been replaced by \code{slice_design}, \code{runif_design}, and \code{sobol_design}, respectively.

The older functions remain in place, but are deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
